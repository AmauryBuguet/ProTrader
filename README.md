## ProTrader : a simple trading interface for Binance that prioritize risk managment

For now this trading UI is adapted to my own trading style, which is scalping on the 5min chart on highly volatile cryptos like Tezos

#### Features:
* Auto-calculation of your order volume according to amount risked on a trade (fees included)
* Auto order type according to lines present on chart
* Move SL and TP lines easily with your mouse
* Overall and daily account statistics
* Support LIMIT, STOP, STOP_MARKET and MARKET orders

#### Will be added
* Possibility to trade other cryptos than XTZ
* Possibility to trade on other timeframes than 5 min
* Possibility to have multiple SL/TP
* Telegram bot to alert user when an order is filled

#### Bugs
* cant replace a TP order if the previous one has been canceled (advised to ALWAYS have a TP when placing an order and ONLY use the MODIFY button to edit it)
* it is advised to have a Binance tab opened in case something goes wrong with this program, this is an open source software in developpement and i'm not responsible in case of any unexpected gains/losses due to a malfunction
* trading is risky, always have a risk managment strategy :)
